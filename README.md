# Health Monitoring AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
Health monitoring AI systems can be used in various healthcare settings, such as hospitals, clinics, and even at home through wearable devices. These systems can help healthcare providers make more informed decisions, improve patient outcomes, and enhance the overall quality of care.
 


## Background

Remote patient monitoring: AI can be used to monitor patients' vital signs and health metrics remotely, allowing healthcare providers to track their condition and intervene if necessary.

Personalized health recommendations: AI algorithms can analyze an individual's health data and provide personalized recommendations for diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes to improve their health.

Early disease detection: AI-powered systems can analyze medical images and other data to detect early signs of diseases such as cancer, enabling earlier intervention and better outcomes.

Health risk assessment: AI can analyze health data to assess an individual's risk of developing certain conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, and provide recommendations for prevention.

Overall, health monitoring AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by providing more personalized and proactive care, leading to better health outcomes for individuals and populations.

code example:
class VirtualPhysician:
    def __init__(self):
        self.symptoms = []

    def add_symptom(self, symptom):
        self.symptoms.append(symptom)

    def diagnose(self):
        if 'fever' in self.symptoms and 'cough' in self.symptoms:
            return "You may have a cold or flu."
        elif 'headache' in self.symptoms and 'nausea' in self.symptoms:
            return "You may have a migraine."
        else:
            return "I'm sorry, I cannot diagnose your condition based on the symptoms provided."

def main():
    physician = VirtualPhysician()

    print("Welcome to the Virtual Physician! Please enter your symptoms one at a time (or type 'done' when finished):")
    while True:
        symptom = input("Enter symptom: ")
        if symptom.lower() == 'done':
            break
        physician.add_symptom(symptom.lower())

    diagnosis = physician.diagnose()
    print("\nDiagnosis:")
    print(diagnosis)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
